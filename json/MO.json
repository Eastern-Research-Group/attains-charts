ADJACENT RIPARIAN CORRIDORS AND OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH URBANIZATION HAVE RESULTED IN THE WARM WATER AQUATIC LIFE DESIGNATED USE BECOMING IMPAIRED.  TOXICITY IS LIKELY CAUSED BY MANY DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS THAT ENTER THE STREAM DURING STORM WATER RUNOFF EVENTS, SUCH AS LOW LEVELS OF PESTICIDES, METALS, PAHS, POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS AND VOCS IN WATER.  ALL WATER BODIES IN MISSOURI ARE PROTECTED BY THE GENERAL NARRATIVE CRITERIA CONTAINED IN MISSOURI'S WQS AT 10 CSR 20-7.031(3).  THESE CRITERIA ARE ALSO CALLED NARRATIVE CRITERIA, SINCE THEY DO NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC NUMERICAL LIMITS.  FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS, CRITERIA (3)(D) AND (G) APPLY: \n  \nD) WATERS SHALL BE FREE FROM SUBSTANCES OR CONDITIONS IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO RESULT IN TOXICITY TO HUMAN, ANIMAL OR AQUATIC LIFE AND;  \nG) WATERS SHALL BE FREE FROM PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL OR HYDROLOGIC CHANGES THAT WOULD IMPAIR THE NATURAL BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY. \n  \nSINCE NO ONE POLLUTANT WAS EXCEEDING A WATER QUALITY CRITERION, NO SPECIFIC NUMERIC WATER QUALITY CRITERIA COULD BE USED AS A TMDL TARGET.  HOWEVER, HYDROLOGIC TARGETS FOR STORM WATER RUNOFF WERE USED AS AN INDICATOR FOR SEDIMENT AND OTHER POLLUTANTS TO DEVELOP THE TMDLS FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS.   \n  \nTHE IMPAIRED REACHES INCLUDE 18 MILES OF WILSON CREEK (WBID 2373) AND 3.8 MILES OF JORDAN CREEK (WBID 3374).  BOTH STREAMS HAVE THE FOLLOWING DESIGNATED BENEFICIAL USES:   \n  \nLIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE WATERING, \nPROTECTION OF WARM WATER AQUATIC LIFE, \nWHOLE BODY CONTACT RECREATION (CATEGORY B) AND \nPROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH (FISH CONSUMPTION)  \n  \nTHE USE THAT IS IMPAIRED IS PROTECTION OF WARM WATER AQUATIC  LIFE. \n  \nWILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS DO NOT CURRENTLY MEET AQUATIC LIFE BENEFICIAL USES.  FOR STREAMS IN URBANIZED AREAS, ADDITIONAL STRESSORS AFFECTING AQUATIC LIFE EXIST IN THE FORM OF NON-POLLUTANT IMPACTS SUCH AS ALTERATIONS IN CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY AND THE FLOW REGIME OR ELIMINATION OF THE RIPARIAN BUFFER.  STORM WATER RUNOFF IS A SURROGATE FOR THE COMPLEX SUITE OF POLLUTANTS AND PHYSICAL STRESSORS CAUSING THE AQUATIC LIFE IMPAIRMENT AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO STORM WATER RUNOFF FROM DEVELOPED AREAS.  THE FDC METHOD IS USED TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE HIGH FLOWS IN WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS TO HIGH FLOWS FROM A SYNTHETIC FLOW RECORD DEVELOPED FROM BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE STREAMS.  THE FDC DESCRIBES IMPORTANT HYDROLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF A WATERSHED AND IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS AND THE SYNTHETIC FLOW DATA FOR THIS TMDL.  WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS FLOW VALUES WERE NORMALIZED BY CALCULATING DAILY AVERAGE FLOW CFS PER SQUARE MILE (CFS/SQUARE MILE) FOR EACH DAY OF THE AVAILABLE PERIOD.  FDCS WERE CALCULATED BY CREATING A SYNTHETIC STREAM FLOW RECORD BY AVERAGING AREA NORMALIZED FLOWS FOR THE REFERENCE STREAMS IN A NINE YEAR PERIOD.  THE LC AT HIGH FLOW AT THE 5 PERCENTILE OF  FLOW EXCEEDANCE IS 349.8 CFS/SQUARE MILE FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS FLOW. \n  \nREDUCING STORM WATER RUNOFF FLOWS TO WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS WILL ADDRESS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPAIRMENT AND RESTORE THE AQUATIC LIFE DESIGNATED USE BY ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING: \n  \nREDUCE PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF STORM WATER ON THE STREAM CHANNEL AND THE"},{"pollutantName":"POLLUTANTS IN URBAN

The EPA guidance recommends that all TMDLs and associated pollutant allocations be expressed in terms of daily time increments, and suggests that there is flexibility in how these daily increments may be expressed. The EPA guidance indicates that where pollutant loads or water body flows are highly dynamic, it may be appropriate to use a load duration curve approach, provided that such an approach identifies the allowable daily pollutant load for any given day as a function of the flow occurring on that day. In addition, for targets that are expressed as a concentration of a pollutant, it may be appropriate to use a table or graph to express individual daily loads over a range of flows as a product of a water quality criterion multiplied by stream flow and a conversion factor.\r\n\r\nThe concentration value of 206 counts/100 mL will serve as the numeric target for TMDL implementation. This targeted concentration will be expressed as a daily load that varies by flow using a load duration curve. Loading at or below the TMDL curve will result in achieving the state’s whole body contact B water quality criterion. Because the whole body contact category B criterion is a geometric mean, fluctuations in instantaneous bacteria concentrations are expected, and individual bacteria measurements greater than the TMDL target do not in and of themselves indicate an exceedance of WQS.

LITTLE SEDIMENT DATA EXISTS TO DIRECTLY DOCUMENT SEDIMENT IMPACTS TO THE STREAM.  GENERAL FISHERIES DATA AND THE EFFECT OF SEDIMENT ON FISH WERE THE INITIAL DATA USED TO CONSIDER MUSSEL FORK CREEK FOR 303(D) LISTING.  FOR THIS TMDL, SEDIMENT TARGETS WERE DERIVED USING GENERALIZED INFORMATION FROM THE ECOLOGICAL DRAINAGE UNIT (EDU).  TSS WAS SELECTED AS THE NUMERIC TARGET FOR THIS TMDL BECAUSE IT ENABLES THE USE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY DATA AVAILABLE, INCLUDING PERMIT CONDITIONS AND MONITORING DATA.  TURBIDITY MEASUREMENTS TAKEN DURING THE BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT WERE USED TO ESTIMATE TSS CONCENTRATIONS USING RELATIONSHIPS DEVELOPED BY DOISEY AND RABENI (2004).  IN THE CASE OF MUSSEL FORK CREEK WHERE NARRATIVE STANDARDS ARE TARGETED FOR THE IMPAIRED STREAM, A REFERENCE APPROACH IS USED.  IN THIS APPROACH, THE TARGET FOR POLLUTANT LOADING IS THE 25TH PERCENTILE OF THE CURRENT EDU CONDITION CALCULATED FROM ALL DATA AVAILABLE WITHIN THE EDU IN WHICH THE WATERBODY IS LOCATED.  THEREFORE, THE 25TH PERCENTILE IS TARGETED AS THE TMDL LOAD DURATION CURVE (LDC).  THE LA IS SET TO 90% OF THE TMDL.  WLA IS THE ALLOWABLE AMOUNT OF THE POLLUTANT THAT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO POINT SOURCES.  THE WLA IS SET TO THE LESSER OF CURRENT PERMIT LIMITS OR TECHNOLOGY BASED EFFLUENT LIMITS (TBELS).  TBELS ARE DEFINED IN A PERMIT BASED ON FACILITY TYPE.  MECHANICAL WWTFS� PERMIT LIMITS ARE A WEEKLY AVERAGE TSS CONCENTRATION OF 45 MG/L AND A MONTHLY AVERAGE TSS CONCENTRATION OF 30 MG/L.  SECONDARY EQUIVALENT WWTFS� PERMIT LIMITS ARE A WEEKLY AVERAGE TSS CONCENTRATION OF 60 MG/L AND A MONTHLY AVERAGE TSS CONCENTRATION OF 45 MG/L.  WASTE WATER TREATMENT LAGOON FACILITIES� PERMIT LIMITS ARE UP TO A WEEKLY AVERAGE TSS CONCENTRATION OF 120 MG/L AND A MONTHLY AVERAGE TSS CONCENTRATION OF 80 MG/L.  ADDITIONALLY, PERMITS CAN BE WRITTEN TO TARGET LOWER LIMITS IF THE SPECIFIC FACILITY IS CAPABLE OF PERFORMANCE EXCEEDING TBELS.  TO ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN THE MODELING AN EXPLICIT 10% MOS IS ASSIGNED TO THIS TMDL.  FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE FLOW PROBABILITY OF 0.7, THE TMDL IS APPROXIMATELY 20 TONS PER DAY.

APPROACH. IN CASES WHERE SUFFICIENT POLLUTANT DATA FOR THE IMPAIRED STREAM IS NOT AVAILABLE A REFERENCE APPROACH IS USED.  THIS PROCEDURE IS USED WHEN A LOTIC SYSTEM IS PLACED ON THE 303(D) IMPAIRED WATERBODY LIST FOR A POLLUTANT AND THE DESIGNATED USE BEING ADDRESSED IS AQUATIC LIFE. THE TARGET FOR POLLUTANT LOADING IS THE 25TH PERCENTILE CALCULATED FROM ALL DATA AVAILABLE WITHIN THE ECOLOGICAL DRAINAGE UNIT (EDU) IN WHICH THE WATERBODY IS LOCATED. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS ALSO UNLIKELY THAT A FLOW RECORD FOR THE IMPAIRED STREAM IS AVAILABLE. IF THIS IS THE CASE A SYNTHETIC FLOW RECORD IS NEEDED. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A SYNTHETIC FLOW RECORD CALCULATE AN AVERAGE OF THE LOG DISCHARGE PER SQUARE MILE OF USGS GAGED RIVERS FOR WHICH THE DRAINAGE AREA IS ENTIRELY CONTAINED WITHIN THE EDU. FROM THIS SYNTHETIC RECORD DEVELOP A FLOW DURATION FROM WHICH TO BUILD A LOAD DURATION CURVE FOR THE POLLUTANT WITHIN THE EDU.  FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT TARGETS USING REFERENCE LOAD DURATION CURVES REFER TO APPENDIX B OF THE TMDL. SPECIFIC DATA  SOURCES FOR THIS TMDLS FLOW AND EDU-WIDE TSS DATA ARE LISTED IN APPENDIX C OF THE TMDL.  WLA IS THE ALLOWABLE AMOUNT OF THE POLLUTANT THAT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO POINT SOURCES. THE WLA IS SET TO THE LESSER OF CURRENT PERMIT LIMITS OR TECHNOLOGY BASED EFFLUENT LIMITS (TBELS). TBELS ARE DEFINED IN A PERMIT BASED ON FACILITY TYPE.  THE PERMITTED POINT SOURCES IN THE WATERSHED AND WLAS BASED ON THEIR CURRENT PERMIT LIMITS AND PERMITTED DESIGN FLOWS. IN ADDITION ALL GENERAL PERMITS NEED FURTHER EVALUATION TO DETERMINE IF A SITE SPECIFIC PERMIT IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS SEDIMENT LOADING. REFER TO THE TMDL FOR ANY PERMIT SPECIFIC INFORMATION.

QUALITY STANDARDS ATTAINMENT: \nWILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS ARE LISTED ON THE EPA-APPROVED 2008 MISSOURI 303(D) LIST AS IMPAIRED DUE TO LOW DIVERSITY OF FISH AND AQUATIC INVERTEBRATE SPECIES.  THE REDUCTION IN THE NATURAL COMMUNITY OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES IS AN EXCEEDANCE OF MISSOURI'S GENERAL WQS FOR PROTECTION OF AQUATIC LIFE AND NATURAL BIOLOGICAL AQUATIC COMMUNITIES.  THE WATER QUALITY LIMITED SEGMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AS IMPAIRED DUE TO MULTIPLE POINT (WILSON CREEK)/URBAN NONPOINT SOURCES (JORDAN CREEK).  A HISTORY OF FISH KILLS, THE PHYSICAL ALTERATION OF STREAM CHANNELS AND ADJACENT RIPARIAN CORRIDORS AND OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH URBANIZATION HAVE RESULTED IN THE WARM WATER AQUATIC LIFE DESIGNATED USE BECOMING IMPAIRED.  TOXICITY IS LIKELY CAUSED BY MANY DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS THAT ENTER THE STREAM DURING STORM WATER RUNOFF EVENTS, SUCH AS LOW LEVELS OF PESTICIDES, METALS, PAHS, POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS AND VOCS IN WATER.  ALL WATER BODIES IN MISSOURI ARE PROTECTED BY THE GENERAL NARRATIVE CRITERIA CONTAINED IN MISSOURI'S WQS AT 10 CSR 20-7.031(3).  THESE CRITERIA ARE ALSO CALLED NARRATIVE CRITERIA, SINCE THEY DO NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC NUMERICAL LIMITS.  FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS, CRITERIA (3)(D) AND (G) APPLY: \n  \nD) WATERS SHALL BE FREE FROM SUBSTANCES OR CONDITIONS IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO RESULT IN TOXICITY TO HUMAN, ANIMAL OR AQUATIC LIFE AND;  \nG) WATERS SHALL BE FREE FROM PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL OR HYDROLOGIC CHANGES THAT WOULD IMPAIR THE NATURAL BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY. \n  \nSINCE NO ONE POLLUTANT WAS EXCEEDING A WATER QUALITY CRITERION, NO SPECIFIC NUMERIC WATER QUALITY CRITERIA COULD BE USED AS A TMDL TARGET.  HOWEVER, HYDROLOGIC TARGETS FOR STORM WATER RUNOFF WERE USED AS AN INDICATOR FOR SEDIMENT AND OTHER POLLUTANTS TO DEVELOP THE TMDLS FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS.   \n  \nTHE IMPAIRED REACHES INCLUDE 18 MILES OF WILSON CREEK (WBID 2373) AND 3.8 MILES OF JORDAN CREEK (WBID 3374).  BOTH STREAMS HAVE THE FOLLOWING DESIGNATED BENEFICIAL USES:   \n  \nLIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE WATERING, \nPROTECTION OF WARM WATER AQUATIC LIFE, \nWHOLE BODY CONTACT RECREATION (CATEGORY B) AND \nPROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH (FISH CONSUMPTION)  \n  \nTHE USE THAT IS IMPAIRED IS PROTECTION OF WARM WATER AQUATIC  LIFE. \n  \nWILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS DO NOT CURRENTLY MEET AQUATIC LIFE BENEFICIAL USES.  FOR STREAMS IN URBANIZED AREAS, ADDITIONAL STRESSORS AFFECTING AQUATIC LIFE EXIST IN THE FORM OF NON-POLLUTANT IMPACTS SUCH AS ALTERATIONS IN CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY AND THE FLOW REGIME OR ELIMINATION OF THE RIPARIAN BUFFER.  STORM WATER RUNOFF IS A SURROGATE FOR THE COMPLEX SUITE OF POLLUTANTS AND PHYSICAL STRESSORS CAUSING THE AQUATIC LIFE IMPAIRMENT AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO STORM WATER RUNOFF FROM DEVELOPED AREAS.  THE FDC METHOD IS USED TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE HIGH FLOWS IN WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS TO HIGH FLOWS FROM A SYNTHETIC FLOW RECORD DEVELOPED FROM BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE STREAMS.  THE FDC DESCRIBES IMPORTANT HYDROLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF A WATERSHED AND IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS AND THE SYNTHETIC FLOW DATA FOR THIS TMDL.  WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS FLOW VALUES WERE NORMALIZED BY CALCULATING DAILY AVERAGE FLOW CFS PER SQUARE MILE (CFS/SQUARE MILE) FOR EACH DAY OF THE AVAILABLE PERIOD.  FDCS WERE CALCULATED BY CREATING A SYNTHETIC STREAM FLOW RECORD BY AVERAGING AREA NORMALIZED FLOWS FOR THE REFERENCE STREAMS IN A NINE YEAR PERIOD.  THE LC AT HIGH FLOW AT THE 5 PERCENTILE OF  FLOW EXCEEDANCE IS 349.8 CFS/SQUARE MILE FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS FLOW. \n  \nREDUCING STORM WATER RUNOFF FLOWS TO WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS WILL ADDRESS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPAIRMENT AND RESTORE THE AQUATIC LIFE DESIGNATED USE BY ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING: \n  \nREDUCE PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF STORM WATER ON THE STREAM CHANNEL AND THE HABITAT IMPAIRMENT OR TOXICITY THAT MAY RESULT FROM SEDIMENTATION. \nRESTORE INCREASED BASE FLOW AND HABITAT THAT

QUALITY STANDARDS ATTAINMENT: \nWILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS ARE LISTED ON THE EPA-APPROVED 2008 MISSOURI 303(D) LIST AS IMPAIRED DUE TO LOW DIVERSITY OF FISH AND AQUATIC INVERTEBRATE SPECIES.  THE REDUCTION IN THE NATURAL COMMUNITY OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES IS AN EXCEEDANCE OF MISSOURI'S GENERAL WQS FOR PROTECTION OF AQUATIC LIFE AND NATURAL BIOLOGICAL AQUATIC COMMUNITIES.  THE WATER QUALITY LIMITED SEGMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AS IMPAIRED DUE TO MULTIPLE POINT (WILSON CREEK)/URBAN NONPOINT SOURCES (JORDAN CREEK).  A HISTORY OF FISH KILLS, THE PHYSICAL ALTERATION OF STREAM CHANNELS AND ADJACENT RIPARIAN CORRIDORS AND OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH URBANIZATION HAVE RESULTED IN THE WARM WATER AQUATIC LIFE DESIGNATED USE BECOMING IMPAIRED.  TOXICITY IS LIKELY CAUSED BY MANY DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS THAT ENTER THE STREAM DURING STORM WATER RUNOFF EVENTS, SUCH AS LOW LEVELS OF PESTICIDES, METALS, PAHS, POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS AND VOCS IN WATER.  ALL WATER BODIES IN MISSOURI ARE PROTECTED BY THE GENERAL NARRATIVE CRITERIA CONTAINED IN MISSOURI'S WQS AT 10 CSR 20-7.031(3).  THESE CRITERIA ARE ALSO CALLED NARRATIVE CRITERIA, SINCE THEY DO NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC NUMERICAL LIMITS.  FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS, CRITERIA (3)(D) AND (G) APPLY: \n  \nD) WATERS SHALL BE FREE FROM SUBSTANCES OR CONDITIONS IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO RESULT IN TOXICITY TO HUMAN, ANIMAL OR AQUATIC LIFE AND;  \nG) WATERS SHALL BE FREE FROM PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL OR HYDROLOGIC CHANGES THAT WOULD IMPAIR THE NATURAL BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY. \n  \nSINCE NO ONE POLLUTANT WAS EXCEEDING A WATER QUALITY CRITERION, NO SPECIFIC NUMERIC WATER QUALITY CRITERIA COULD BE USED AS A TMDL TARGET.  HOWEVER, HYDROLOGIC TARGETS FOR STORM WATER RUNOFF WERE USED AS AN INDICATOR FOR SEDIMENT AND OTHER POLLUTANTS TO DEVELOP THE TMDLS FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS.   \n  \nTHE IMPAIRED REACHES INCLUDE 18 MILES OF WILSON CREEK (WBID 2373) AND 3.8 MILES OF JORDAN CREEK (WBID 3374).  BOTH STREAMS HAVE THE FOLLOWING DESIGNATED BENEFICIAL USES:   \n  \nLIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE WATERING, \nPROTECTION OF WARM WATER AQUATIC LIFE, \nWHOLE BODY CONTACT RECREATION (CATEGORY B) AND \nPROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH (FISH CONSUMPTION)  \n  \nTHE USE THAT IS IMPAIRED IS PROTECTION OF WARM WATER AQUATIC  LIFE. \n  \nWILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS DO NOT CURRENTLY MEET AQUATIC LIFE BENEFICIAL USES.  FOR STREAMS IN URBANIZED AREAS, ADDITIONAL STRESSORS AFFECTING AQUATIC LIFE EXIST IN THE FORM OF NON-POLLUTANT IMPACTS SUCH AS ALTERATIONS IN CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY AND THE FLOW REGIME OR ELIMINATION OF THE RIPARIAN BUFFER.  STORM WATER RUNOFF IS A SURROGATE FOR THE COMPLEX SUITE OF POLLUTANTS AND PHYSICAL STRESSORS CAUSING THE AQUATIC LIFE IMPAIRMENT AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO STORM WATER RUNOFF FROM DEVELOPED AREAS.  THE FDC METHOD IS USED TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE HIGH FLOWS IN WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS TO HIGH FLOWS FROM A SYNTHETIC FLOW RECORD DEVELOPED FROM BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE STREAMS.  THE FDC DESCRIBES IMPORTANT HYDROLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF A WATERSHED AND IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS AND THE SYNTHETIC FLOW DATA FOR THIS TMDL.  WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS FLOW VALUES WERE NORMALIZED BY CALCULATING DAILY AVERAGE FLOW CFS PER SQUARE MILE (CFS/SQUARE MILE) FOR EACH DAY OF THE AVAILABLE PERIOD.  FDCS WERE CALCULATED BY CREATING A SYNTHETIC STREAM FLOW RECORD BY AVERAGING AREA NORMALIZED FLOWS FOR THE REFERENCE STREAMS IN A NINE YEAR PERIOD.  THE LC AT HIGH FLOW AT THE 5 PERCENTILE OF  FLOW EXCEEDANCE IS 349.8 CFS/SQUARE MILE FOR WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS FLOW. \n  \nREDUCING STORM WATER RUNOFF FLOWS TO WILSON AND JORDAN CREEKS WILL ADDRESS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPAIRMENT AND RESTORE THE AQUATIC LIFE DESIGNATED USE BY ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING: \n  \nREDUCE PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF STORM WATER ON THE STREAM CHANNEL AND THE HABITAT IMPAIRMENT OR TOXICITY THAT MAY RESULT FROM SEDIMENTATION. \nRESTORE INCREASED BASE FLOW AND HABITAT THAT

SEDIMENTATION OCCURS WHEN WIND OR WATER RUNOFF CARRIES SOIL PARTICLES FROM AN AREA AND TRANSPORTS THEM TO A STREAM OR LAKE.
